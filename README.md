Performed Exploratory data analysis on the dataset and performed data cleaning, sanity checking of the data, feature engineering, scaling of the data and implemented several machine learning models using algorithms which include Linear regression, polynomial regression, Elastic net regression, KNN regression, support vector regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression by modeling the parameters of various models using Grid search CV.
